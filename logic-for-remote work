In case someone asks, why is your university / lab shutting down? You can forward them this, as a call to action:
1. We face an “exponential threat”: a viral outbreak. Our brains have a really hard time reacting appropriately in the face of exponential threats. An exponential threat can grow and grow and not have an impact, and then suddenly boom, it’s overwhelming. That’s why start-ups can disrupt entire industries, solar & wind now gain market share from fossil fuels... because these “threats” to the old world order were under-estimated by decision-makers because of their small magnitude, while the alarming exponential growth rates were ignored.
2. The immediate danger we need to work collectively to avoid, is that our healthcare system is overrun by this exponential threat. All people will suffer (not just the old) if we continue allowing exponential growth of new cases [1]. As Bergamo, Qom, and Wuhan have shown, complacency yields death rates of 4–6%. As Singapore has shown, advance action yields death rates of 0–1%. SARS-hit regions like Singapore are slowing the exponential threat by engaging vigorous social distancing policies early.
3. Why can’t we go about our daily lives in the U.S. right now, like Singapore is doing? Simply, we haven’t done enough work to stop community transmission in the U.S. yet. Despite a lack of official testing data, there are numerous indications [2] that community transmission of hCoV-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is happening right now in the U.S., unopposed by health authorities until just a few days ago.
4. The sooner we act, the less bad the next 2–3 weeks will be. The last few charts in Ref. [3] show why this is. It relates to exponential growth vs. a fixed healthcare system capacity, and the fixed incubation period between “action” and “system response.”
5. Filling the vacuum of national leadership, is a strong public call to action: every organization must do its part to implement social distancing measures NOW, “flatten the curve,” and make sure transmission is reduced so our local healthcare systems don’t get overwhelmed [3]. Because of the viral incubation period, won’t see the benefits of our action (or the penalty of inaction) until a week or two. But math tells us, if we delay taking action by even one day, the impact of exponential case growth on the healthcare system can be severe — see last plots in [2].
6. Note that healthcare systems do not quickly bounce back from being overwhelmed during a pandemic. You lose experienced people [4]. And other people with routine hospital needs (childbirth, cancer, AIDS, chronic illness, the flu...) will suffer [1]. No, it’s not “just” the old people who will die.
7. There’s a chance that I’m wrong. But the math sure keeps coming back supporting these hypotheses. The +33% caseload reported yesterday in the U.S. [5] was spot on the curve of uncontrolled community transmission for this particular virus, and matches the curves of Italy and Korea before extreme social distancing measures were adopted. So I decided to take action. I appreciate the lab’s efforts to lead in this public effort to “flatten the curve.”
8. There are moments that define a generation, when the whole of society is called to action at once to oppose an oncoming threat. Willing or unwilling, you may be part of one such moment right now. What gives me courage to act, is the knowledge that when facing a credible exponential threat, the penalty for inaction (healthcare system overwhelmed, >4% death rate of COVID-19-positive patients) is clearly greater than the penalty for action (inconvenience, 4 weeks’ work lost).
As always, I’m receptive to your thoughts and questions.
